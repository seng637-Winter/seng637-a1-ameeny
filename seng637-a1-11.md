## 1. Introduction

In this lab, our objective was to deepen our comprehension of software testing through hands-on experience with a simulated ATM application and the use of Jira for tracking software defects. We engaged in various testing methodologies including exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing, building upon our initial understanding of these concepts from the SENG 637 lectures. Although we started with basic knowledge, actual application of these testing techniques and tools was a new and enlightening experience for our team.

## 2. Exploratory Testing Plan Overview

Our exploratory testing plan was structured as follows:

1. We began by reviewing the specified requirements of the ATM simulation to identify key functionalities for testing, such as card validation, cash withdrawal, and deposit among others.
2. We then planned to test these functions under various scenarios, including normal operations, boundary conditions, and error handling, to explore their behavior under different inputs and actions.
3. The testing process involved documenting the initial state, actions taken, expected outcomes, and actual outcomes for each test scenario.
4. An example of our approach is detailed in Table 1, where we tested the operator controls function, illustrating our methodical approach to exploratory testing.

**Table 1.** Exploratory Testing for Operator Controls
| **Function Tested** | **Initial State** | **Steps** | **Expected Outcome** | **Actual Outcome** | **Result** |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Operator Controls - ON | Machine off, displaying "Not Available" | Press ON button | Machine requests bill count | As expected | Pass |
| Operator Controls - OFF | Machine off, displaying "Not Available" | Press OFF button | Machine shuts down | As expected | Pass |
| Operator Controls - OFF | During transaction | Press OFF button | Machine remains on | As expected | Pass |

## 3. Exploratory vs. Manual Functional Testing

Exploratory testing allowed us to dynamically explore and test the ATM system's functionalities without predefined scripts, enabling flexibility and immediate adaptation to the system's responses. This contrasted with manual functional testing, which required a structured approach with predefined test cases. While exploratory testing leverages tester intuition and adaptability, manual testing focuses on systematic coverage and repeatability. Each method has its trade-offs, with exploratory testing depending on the tester's skill for effectiveness and manual testing possibly overlooking unscripted scenarios.

## 4. Peer Review Insights

The peer review process revealed the importance of diverse testing strategies, as different teams identified unique defects. This underscored the value of collaborative defect identification and the necessity for a standardized logging system to streamline communication and ensure all defects are captured and addressed efficiently.

## 5. Managing Pair Testing and Collaboration

We divided our team into pairs to conduct exploratory testing, rotating roles to maximize defect identification. This approach not only facilitated a comprehensive exploration of the ATM system but also fostered teamwork and knowledge sharing. Subsequent manual and regression testing followed a similar collaborative approach, with each team member contributing to the testing and documentation process.

## 6. Challenges, Solutions, and Learnings

Throughout this assignment, we navigated several challenges, from developing an effective testing plan to learning the nuances of collaborative testing and defect tracking with Jira. Our experience highlighted the importance of a well-structured testing strategy and the benefits of teamwork in identifying and documenting software defects. We also recognized the efficiency of integrating our findings into a single Jira project early on to avoid duplicate efforts and streamline the defect management process.

In conclusion, this lab provided us with invaluable practical experience in software testing, enhancing our understanding of different testing methodologies, the significance of effective team collaboration, and the practical use of defect tracking systems.
