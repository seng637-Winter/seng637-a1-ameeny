## 1. Introduction

In this lab, our objective was to deepen our comprehension of software testing through hands-on experience with a simulated ATM application and the use of Jira for tracking software defects. We engaged in various testing methodologies including exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing, building upon our initial understanding of these concepts from the SENG 637 lectures. Although we started with basic knowledge, actual application of these testing techniques and tools was a new and enlightening experience for our team.

## 2. High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory testing plan was structured as follows:

1. We began by reviewing the specified requirements of the ATM simulation to identify key functionalities for testing, such as card validation, cash withdrawal, and deposit among others.
2. We then planned to test these functions under various scenarios, including normal operations, boundary conditions, and error handling, to explore their behavior under different inputs and actions.
3. The testing process involved documenting the initial state, actions taken, expected outcomes, and actual outcomes for each test scenario.
4. Any unexpected outcomes were created as bugs on the Jira platform, which logs are provided in this repository as `<FILE_NAME>`.

## 3. Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing allowed us to dynamically explore and test the ATM system's functionalities without predefined scripts, enabling flexibility and immediate adaptation to the system's responses. This contrasted with manual functional testing, which required a structured approach with predefined test cases. While exploratory testing leverages tester intuition and adaptability, manual testing focuses on systematic coverage and repeatability. Each method has its trade-offs, with exploratory testing depending on the tester's effectiveness and manual testing possibly overlooking unscripted scenarios. 

As a result, exploratory testing led to finding more bugs compared to manual function testing. While predefined manual function testing allows for following a structured method for an SUT (System Under Test), it's limited not only by the use cases, but also the quality of the scripts, e.g. how well detailed the written inputs, expected outputs, etc. are, or how thoroughly they prescribe testing. 

## 4. Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

The peer review process revealed the importance of diverse testing strategies, as different unique defects were identified by all of us. This underscored the value of collaborative defect identification and the necessity for a standardized logging system to streamline communication and ensure all defects are captured and addressed efficiently. We did, however, find a few of the same defects. Upon reviewing our bug reports, we all duplicates. 

## 5. How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided

We divided our team into a pair and group of three for pair testing, rotating roles to maximize defect identification. Each group spent about an hour of testing following our exploratory test plan. This approach not only facilitated a comprehensive exploration of the ATM system but also fostered teamwork and knowledge sharing. Subsequent manual and regression testing followed a similar collaborative approach, with each team member contributing to the testing and documentation process.

## 6. Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Throughout this assignment, we navigated several challenges, from developing an effective testing plan to learning the nuances of collaborative testing and defect tracking with Jira. Our experience highlighted the importance of a well-structured testing strategy and the benefits of teamwork in identifying and documenting software defects. We also recognized the efficiency of integrating our findings into a single Jira project early on to avoid duplicate efforts and streamline the defect management process. 

While we had a plan for how we were going to create defect reports on Jira, we could've benefited from a more structured format to keep reporting consistent.

This assignment taught us the trade-offs between exploratory and and manual scripted testing and made the testing process more familiar. It further taught us that 

In conclusion, this lab provided us with insight into testing, enhancing our understanding of different testing methodologies, the significance of effective team collaboration, and the practical use of defect tracking systems.
